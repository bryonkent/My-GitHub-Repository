"1 Data are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. A margin of error is a measure of an estimate's variability.  The larger the margin of error in relation to the size of the estimate, the less reliable the estimate. When added to and subtracted from the estimate, the margin of error forms the 90-percent confidence interval.   An asterisk (*) denotes  a statistically significant difference between the state or state equivalent and the United States/Puerto Rico total at the 90-percent confidence interval.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   For more information on veterans, please visit http://www.census.gov/topics/population/veterans.html                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Source: U.S. Census Bureau, 2009-2013 American Community Survey, and 2009-2013 Puerto Rico Community Survey.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
